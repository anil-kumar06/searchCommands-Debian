For example: I have to search a commad to list directories. 

In the query field I'll write "list directory". 
I'll get an output as below.
Output :
dir (1)              - list directory contents
ls (1)               - list directory contents
ntfsls (8)           - list directory contents on an NTFS filesystem
vdir (1)             - list directory contents

It means above commands can be used to list directories.
